* ## Templates

  * Career cup: https://www.careercup.com/resume
  * Deedy resume: https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume
  * It's totally fine to have a simple resume. Nothing fancy is required - No images, colors, fancy fonts, headings, quotes, etc.


* ## Action words

  * Make sure every line starts with an action word:
  * * Eg: Worked on, Created, Added, Implemented, Discovered, Generated, Collaborated, Researched, Managed, etc.

* ## Work experience

  * Ideally 3-4 experiences with 2-3 points each.
  * Make sure the dates are accurate - can also mention spring/summer/fall.
  * Common headings: software engineer, web developer, mobile developer, intern etc.
  * Add a line at the end for Tools: Angular, Flutter, Dart, Testing, something, something.
  * Don't add things like: using VSCode, Vim, etc. No one wants to know your code editor preferences.
  * You CAN add experiences outside of coding/computer science if you learnt something new and have space for it. It's better to have a real experience than nothing!
  * Examples
  * * Added some features using frontend technologies, which eventually went into production.
    * Worked on something which brought the revenue up by some %.
    * Implemented login functionality with authentication service using Firebase and Node JS.


* ## Projects

  * Ideally 3-4 projects with 1-2 points each.
  * Use school projects if you don't have any personal projects (start working :)).
  * Mention the skills you learnt or used. Eg: HTML, CSS, JS, Git.
  * It's fine to add other projects as well - maybe you did marketing for someone and helped them increase their numbers!
  * Examples
  * * [30dayscoding](https://30dayscoding.com): Made a website for computer science students preparing for coding interviews including an all in one technical interview guide.
    * Created a landing page for the website to generate initial traffic before launch.
    * Worked as a freelancer to create 3 pages using something, something.


* ## Education

  * A lot of people argue that education should come before work ex/projects - but here's the real deal: It doesn't matter.
  * Add your degree, courses, clubs, activities, experiences, projects, etc. You can mention jobs/side things you did in your university.
  * Eg: 
  * * B.S. in Computer Science, 2020. 
    * GPA: doesn't matter.


* ## Skills

  * Add programming languages, tech stacks that you've used/are learning.
  * * Languages: Python; Java; Dart; JavaScript; Typescript.
    * Technology: Android; Flutter; React Native.
  * It's fine to fake-it-till-you-make-it when submitting your resume but make sure you know it before your interviews.
  * You can also add soft skills - they help the resume parse through the ATS software sometimes. Eg: communication, leadership etc.


* ## Summary

  * Don't add a summary section unless you have space for it. Most resumes pass through an ATS software before coming in front of someone's eyes, so don't waste time on a summary.
  * Generics things can be avoided most of the time. Everyone is a 'hardworking software engineer with excellent skills', don't add it here. Instead, add it in the skills section (if you have space). Eg: soft skills: communication, leadership, etc.


* ## Links

  * Add links for your Github, linkedin, Angel list, Twitter profiles.
  * A lot of times managers, recruiters look at these profiles and directly contact you from there, so it's a nice-to-have.
  * Github: Add school projects (with permission) if you don't have any personal ones, or just fork other repositories which you like. Keep exploring!


* ## Harsh reality

  * No one looks at your resume!
  * * Recruiters or managers screen it after you've cleared your first round of online coding interviews.
    * Even then, they will ask you to explain most things, like: 'what's your favorite project', or 'which tech stack are you most comfortable in' - they want you to explain it.
  * Don't put in a lot of time
  * * It's fine to have a decent resume, but preparing for interviews or actually making some projects is far more important.
    * Apply to limited companies, prepare for those, and focus on clearing the interviews you get. Prepare well!
    * Getting a first round interview from a hundred companies <<<< Getting an offer from 1 company after applying to 10.
  * Don't pay someone to do a resume review
  * * Ask your friends.
    * Ask someone in your university - consultants, professors, etc.
    * Lookout for free resources like this one.
    * If you still need help, ping me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryansingh2/)
* Don't follow this blindly

  * I'm just another random guy on the internet and all this comes from my personal experiences, so don't take it too seriously and feel free to make tweaks according to what you feel is the best. Just here to help! Good luck

Mostly applicable for tech positions.

* ## Cold emails
* * Cold email => emailing someone you don't know. It's the best proven way to get in front of someone's eyes directly and get noticed directly.
  * You can send emails to hiring managers, recruiters telling them something about yourself and discussing a position/referral with them.
  * ### Selling point
  * * They get thousands of emails every day, so it's important to highlight what's unique about you! Doesn't have to be too fancy, just a simple email with some important points.
    * Could be anything - github profile, work experiences, projects, hackathons, projects, grade, certificates, courses, etc.
  * ### Template

    * Go to https://30dayscoding.com/ checkout the tech interview guide and find the template there :)
  * ### Here's the flow

    * Find the relevant person on linkedin - recruiter, hiring manager
    * Send them a message on LinkedIn
    * * Hey recruiter, I'm interested in the xyz position in your company! My past experience at abc would make me a strong candidate for this position, I've attached my resume and look forward to your response!
    * Find their email
    * * Use https://leadleaper.com/, https://contactout.com/, https://pipileads.com/
      * Ask your friends, teachers, relatives if they know people at these companies and email them.
      * Ask your linkedin connections if they're connected with someone you're not. People put their emails there sometimes.
      * Github: A lot of software engineers, managers put their email there, take it from there.
    * Prepare a template, find it on https://30dayscoding.com/
    * Schedule an email for 8am their timezone (mon-fri), and wait for their reply. Make sure to follow up with a small
  * This can be a game changer for 1st round interviews - I got 2: Google and Dell, by simply emailing the recruiters!
* ## University career fairs (Offline)

  * All universities have career fairs once or twice a year which can be very useful to make good connections at companies. Companies send software engineers and/or recruiters to the career fair so it’s a good chance to meet them and have a good first impression.
  * Checkout the companies coming, do your homework on them, prepare for simple coding questions, and be confident. Make genuine connections with people there, and have a fun time. Be real. Talk like a friend, ask good questions, give them your resume, and sound interested even if you're not!
  * Imagine yourself in their position - they're talking to hundreds of potential candidates, so what can you do to stand out? Prepare a background story, sound interested, and have a normal conversation. Don't be like "I'm a confident leader, who would be great for the job".
  * Eg: <https://www.umass.edu/careers/CareerFairSchedule>
* ## Online Career Fairs

  * There are events happening across the globe where companies hire developers and connect with each other.
  * Some amazing examples
  * * [GreyLock](https://web.cvent.com/event/b675ae0c-0cdb-4e95-810d-d7c2812faf93/regProcessStep1)
    * [Startup Fair](https://startupfair.com/)
  * There’s an application process => apply, get in, and have a good time.
* ## LinkedIn job portal

  * https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/
  * Make a good linkedin profile
  * * Add relevant experiences and projects, small bio, and some relevant posts about what you're doing these days.
    * No one is staring at your profile for hours so don't spend too much time on it :P
  * Easy apply and share your profile - make sure your profile is complete if you're looking to easily apply.
  * Add projects, get endorsed for skills, add nice headings and summaries. Most people don't look at your summaries/bio/projects but it's helpful when you're applying through linkedIn.

* ## Referrals

  * Referrals make you a better candidate than others and can get you the first round interview quicker. Most big companies do this and you're already at step #2 (most of the time) if you get one. This does not mean direct access to something, just that you'll get a response faster or maybe 1 less interview.
  * Developers working at companies often get incentives if someone joins the company from their referral, so there’s nothing to feel shy about this.
  * Flow: Email/message someone you know or cold email someone you don't. Send a simple message asking for the referral and try to sell yourself in 1-2 lines. Remember, be prepared before asking. The other person needs to actually like your profile because there's no obligation involved.
* ## Networking

  * Connect with people from different websites, send them a message and try to see if they have anything to offer. This is a great way to meet founders/co-founders and ask if they're looking for new talent. They're always on a lookout for developers to join, so win-win for both.
  * * “Hey person, hope you’re doing well. It was great talking to you the other day about xyz. I would love to further connect with you on LinkedIn and discuss abc”.
    * “Hey person, hope you’re doing well. I loved your website/company/project and would love to talk to you regarding some collaborations/career opportunities/inputs. Thank you” - Works great, everyone likes to meet nice people.
  * ### Events

    * Tons of events happen across the year where companies hire developers directly, lookout for those through your university portal, linkedin, or other websites. Eg: Grace hopper - https://ghc.anitab.org/
    * There are career fairs as well, where companies come directly and look for talents. Don't miss those out if you're eligible to attend. Always a nice opportunity to meet new people and get that new opportunity.
    * Hackathons
    * * I love hackathons - free food, awesome projects, amazing people, and wonderful ideas. Work on a project for 24-36 hrs straight and present your idea to win prizes and what not. Meet like minded people and network with different company representatives present there.
      * http://hackathonsnear.me/
      * https://mlh.io/
* ## Discord, reddit

  * Discord has amazing communities for skills, eg: You know Angular. Search for the Angular community on google and join it. Help people there, ask for projects, work for free, and make a good name. Add those things to your resume and maybe ask for a referral/recommendation
  * There's also a job/contract/careers section where people are constantly looking for new contract developers. Message random people, get to know their projects/startups, and start working. Remote work has made this huge, people are looking all the time.
  * Eg: https://discord.com/invite/angular
* ## Online - careers website

  * Companies have direct links to the job openings they offer and it’s usually under the ‘careers’ section. So just like Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/careers/) most companies have a designated page for their jobs.
  * This is my least favorite way of applying and it should be the same for you. There are other better ways mentioned below which have a higher interview rate than this one.
  * As an international student (in the USA), you should probably only do this as the last resort - most of the applications go through a screening process and it's harder to be noticed.
* ## Remember

  * You don't have to apply for 100s of positions to get an offer. Be PREPARED -> solve coding problems, make projects, and have fun. The ideal scenario should be to interview at 10-15 companies and then finally get 2-3 offers. Work hard, but also enjoy the process. Don't just do it for a job.
  * If you're looking for a job/internship right now - understand one thing. Things take time. Be consistent and enjoy the process -> learn something new from this -> prepare for coding interviews -> and when you do get a job (which you will) -> give back to the community! You got this. Good luck!
